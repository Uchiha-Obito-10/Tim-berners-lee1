            Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.

            He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up which uses, promotes and helps develop the open
            source Solid platform.
            Solid aims to give people control and agency over their data, questioning many assumptions about how the web
            has to work.
            Solid technically is is new level of standard at the web layer, which adds things never put into the
            original spec, such as global single sign-on,
            universal access control, and a universal data API so that any app can store data in any storage place.
            Socially Solid is a movement away from much of the issues with the current WWW, and toward a world in which
            users are in control,
            and empowered by large amounts of data, private, shared, and public.<br>
            Sir Tim is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web standards organization founded in 1994
            which develops interoperable technologies
            (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential. He is a Director of
            the World Wide Web Foundation which was
            launched in 2009 to coordinate efforts to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity.
